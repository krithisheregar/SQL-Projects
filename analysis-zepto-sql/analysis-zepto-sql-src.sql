DATA EXPLORATION
============================================================

 1. Count of rows
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM dbo.zepto;


 2. Sample data
SELECT TOP 10 *
FROM dbo.zepto;


 3. Check for NULL values
SELECT *
FROM dbo.zepto
WHERE name IS NULL
   OR catery IS NULL
   OR mrp IS NULL
   OR discountPercent IS NULL
   OR discountedSellingPrice IS NULL
   OR weightInGms IS NULL
   OR availableQuantity IS NULL
   OR outOfStock IS NULL
   OR quantity IS NULL;


 4. Different product cateries
SELECT DISTINCT catery
FROM dbo.zepto
ORDER BY catery;


 5. Products in stock vs out of stock
SELECT outOfStock, COUNT(sku_id) AS count_of_products
FROM dbo.zepto
GROUP BY outOfStock;


 6. Product names appearing multiple times
SELECT name, COUNT(sku_id) AS [Number of SKUs]
FROM dbo.zepto
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(sku_id) > 1
ORDER BY [Number of SKUs] DESC;


============================================================
 DATA CLEANING
============================================================

 1. Products with price = 0
SELECT *
FROM dbo.zepto
WHERE mrp = 0 OR discountedSellingPrice = 0;


 2. Delete products with MRP = 0
DELETE FROM dbo.zepto
WHERE mrp = 0;


 3. Convert paise to rupees
UPDATE dbo.zepto
SET mrp = mrp / 100.0,
    discountedSellingPrice = discountedSellingPrice / 100.0;


 4. Check updated price columns
SELECT mrp, discountedSellingPrice
FROM dbo.zepto;
